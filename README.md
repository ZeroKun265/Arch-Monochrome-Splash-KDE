# Arch Monochrome Splash
Arch Monochrome Splash is a  custom splash screen for KDE that i made mostly for personal use
I AM NOT a theme developer, i will only make modifications if i will be benefiting from this, but feel free to use this as a base (after all that's what i did too)

How to install:
1. Download the repo or clone the repo
2. Move the src folder to the themes folder with the command `mv /path/to/src $HOME/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/Arch-Monochrome-Splash`

Wallpaper provided by Jhook2015 on wallpapercave, didn't know how to ask permission so i'll just credit him
Check out Amethyst theme, the one i used as a base for this and my old daily driver, really cool
